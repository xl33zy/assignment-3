Implementation and test of MyLinkedListQueue and MyLinkedListStack in java for Algorithms and Data Structures couse in Astana IT University

MyLinkedListQueue
MyLinkedListQueue is a queue data structure that uses a linked list to store its elements. The queue follows a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. 

MyLinkedListStack
MyLinkedListStack is a stack data structure that uses a linked list to store its elements. The stack follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
